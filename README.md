# SMPL Compiler

This is a simple compiler for the SMPL (Simple Programming Language) written in Python from scratch. SMPL is a minimalist programming language designed for educational purposes, making it an excellent choice for learning about compiler construction.

This compiler includes the parser and lexer and generates optimized SSA-based intermediate representation.

## SMPL Language Features

SMPL is a minimalistic language with basic features, including:

- Variable declarations and assignments.
- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Conditionals (if statements).
- Loops (while loops).

Here's a simple example of a SMPL program:

```python
# This is a comment
x = 5
y = 10

if x < y:
    z = x + y
else:
    z = x - y

while z > 0:
    z = z - 1
```
